Todo:

* Determine whether ECs (correctly) migrate between bins of the p-tilde-distribution 

* Mathematically/Statistically derive p-hat
* Check probability-interpretation on MC (should be uniformly distributed for multiple sections of dicing rounds)
* Define discovery (/ exclusion??) thresholds
* Compute sample-p-hats on signal
* Determine models/parameter-spaces that could be discovered by MUSiC
* (Determine models/parameter-spaces that could/can??? be excluded by MUSiC???)

Thesis:

Theory:
    - Standard Model: Particles and Forces
    - LHC and CMS

MUSiC:
    - Motivation
    - Event + Object Selection
    - Classification
    - Scanning
    - More in detail: dicing, correlations

p-hat:
    - Motivation (global significance index)

Discovery Potential of a Model Independent Search for New Physics at the LHC
============================================================================

*Master Thesis by Jonas Lieb, Handed in at III. Physikalisches Institut der RWTH Aachen, in August 2017*

In 2015 and 2016, the CMS detector recorded proton-proton collisions at an unprecedented center of mass energy of 13TeV. The Model Unspecific Search in CMS (MUSiC) provides an automated search for various possible signatures of new
physics in these data.

In a three step process, MUSiC first classifies events according to the physics content of the final state, searches a set of kinematic distributions for the most significant deviations between Standard Model Monte Carlo simulations and observed data and finally applies a statistical hypothesis test to draw conclusions about indications of new physics in the observed dataset.

In this thesis, the discovery potential towards new physics is assessed. For this purpose, a quantification of the test power is defined. Subsequently, the framework is applied to simulated events of four benchmark models for new physics. Alongside the discovery potential towards these theories, the influence of several existing and newly introduced features and parameters on the sensitivity is measured.

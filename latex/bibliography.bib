  Abstract                 = {The start of the LHC in the year 2009 has given access to
 the energy regime beyond the TeV scale. Different theories
 of particle physics developed in the past years and decades
 give reason to expect new phenomena at that energy scale,
 such as new particles or modified couplings. Many of these
 phenomena are predicted to show effects in various final
 states with different particle content. The many
 possibilities arising from the large number of theories make
 it difficult to provide dedicated analyses for each
 thinkable signature. Furthermore, it is impossible to
 estimate which models have not been covered by theoretical
 approaches, and thus might be overlooked by dedicated
 analyses. This thesis presents a complementary approach
 where large parts of the data recorded with the CMS detector
 are classified by their physics content (electrons, muons,
 jets, etc.) and systematically scanned for deviations from
 the Standard-Model prediction (Monte-Carlo simulation). In
 this thesis the results of the Model Unspecific Search in
 CMS (MUSiC) with special focus on data taken in the year
 2011 are presented. No significant deviations from the
 Standard-Model prediction have been found in the analysed
 2011 CMS data.},

  Abstract                 = {A Model Unspecific Search in CMS (MUSiC) is presented in
 this work, along with its results on the data taken in 2010
 by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) at the Large Hadron
 Collider (LHC). This analysis shows a sensitivity to various
 models for new physics and provides a broad view at the
 data, due to its minimal theoretical bias. Events are
 classified with respect to their reconstructed objects:
 Muons, electrons, photons, jets and missing transverse
 energy. Up to three kinematic variables in each of these
 classes are systematically scanned for continuous bin
 regions deviating significantly from the predictions by the
 Standard Model of particle physics. No deviations beyond
 expected fluctuations are observed, when taking systematic
 uncertainties into account. The sensitivity of the analysis
 to certain models beyond the Standard Model is
 demonstrated.},

\chapter{Introduction}


\section{Units and Abbreviations}
Throughout this work, we will use the natural unit system. This means that the speed of light and the Planck constant are fixed to $1$:
\begin{equation*}
    \hbar = c = 1
\end{equation*}
It follows that the only unit needed to express most other physical quantities is the unit of energy. Our choice here is electron volts. Too keep numbers in a reasonable range, we mostly use gigaelectronvolts: $\SI{1}{\giga\eV} = \SI{1.60218e-10}{\joule}$.
Two exceptions to this are the cross section and luminosity, which are expressed in femtobarn and inverse femtobarn respectively: $\SI{1}{\femto\barn} = \SI{e-43}{\meter\squared}$.

\section{Particle Physics}
Finding the building blocks of matter has interested mankind for thousands of years. Ancient Greek philosophers already contemplated about the basic building blocks of matter. They coined the term \emph{atom} for what they thought to be indivisible. Since then, our understanding of the smallest parts and what holds them together has vastly improved. This field of science is nowadays called \emph{Elementary Particle Physics}. As of 2017, the state of particle physics research is summed up in the so called \emph{Standard Model of Particle Physics}.

In the following sections, we will give a short introduction to the Standard Model, its theoretical foundations and open questions. Motivated by these questions, we will introduce possible extensions to the Standard Model in the next chapter.

This chapter is based on \cite{Hebbeker:SkriptzurElementarteilchenphysik} if not explicitly stated otherwise.

\section{The Standard Model}
The Standard Model is a description of matter and its interactions, except gravity. It is based on the theoretical foundations of quantum field theory.


\subsection{Particles and Interactions}
According to the Standard Model, elementary particles are point-like indivisible structureless objects, much like the atoms were to the ancient Greeks. These objects are characterized by physical observables such as mass, charge and spin.

    \label{fig:particle_groups}
\end{figure}

\Fref{fig:particle_groups} shows how elementary particles can be separated into several groups. 
At first level there are two groups: \emph{fermions} and \emph{bosons}.

Fermions are elementary particles with a spin of $\nicefrac{1}{2}$. They follow Fermi-Dirac statistics and have to obey Pauli's exclusion principle which states that no more than one particle can occupy a certain state characterized by its quantum numbers.
The group of fermions can be further divided into quarks and leptons.
There are six quarks: up (\Pup), down (\Pdown), charm (\Pcharm), strange (\Pstrange), bottom (\Pbottom) and top (\Ptop). Quarks carry color charge and are the only objects to take part in the strong interaction.
In addition, there are three lepton families: \emph{electron} (\Pe), \emph{muon} (\Pmu) and \emph{tau} (\Ptau). Each charged lepton has a very light, electrically neutral \emph{neutrino} associated with it.

The second group of particles are called bosons. They mediate interactions (also called \emph{forces}) and posses an integer spin. Bosons follow Bose-Einstein statistics and may thus occupy the same quantum state.
Each kind of boson is responsible for one kind of elementary force: the electrodynamic force is mediated by the \emph{photon}, the strong force by the \emph{gluon} and the weak force by the \emph{\PZ} and \emph{\PW} bosons.
In addition, there is the \emph{Higgs boson} (\PH), which uses the Higgs mechanism to give mass to all mentioned massive elementary particles.\footnote{Note that this does not apply to composite particles (like protons) which gain mask mostly through binding energy.}

\subsection{Open Questions}
Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, all particles predicted by the Standard Model have been experimentally observed. The Standard Model has not been disproved and multiple Nobel prices have been awarded.
One could assume that our understanding of nature is now complete, but this is not the case:
In the recent decades, several observations have been made that demand  theories beyond the Standard Model. In the following sections, we want to discuss a few of them.

%Observations: gravitational waves (2016), neutrino masses

\subsubsection{Astrophysical Observations}
One astrophysical research method is to probe whether observed gravitational effects can be completely accounted for by visible matter distributions. For this purpose, the rotation curves of galaxies have been measured and shown to be incompatible with simulations of visible matter only. Also, fluctuations in gravitational lensing without a visible origin has been observed.\cite{Bertone:Particledarkmatter,Peebles:Cosmologicalconstantdark}
Furthermore, several experiments have probed the cosmic microwave background for anisotropies. These data have subsequently been compared to the matter distributions obtained by simulations of the early universe according to the $\Uplambda$CDM model. The results indicated that only about \SI{5}{\percent} of the universe is made up of conventional (baryonic) matter.\cite{Planck:Planck2015results}
% https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.0939v2.pdf

All of these findings suggest that there must be a large amount of matter in the universe that only interacts gravitationally. Because of its electromagnetic invisibility, it is called \emph{Dark Matter}.
Since the Standard Model does not provide a fitting Dark Matter candidate, this is an active field of research also at particle collider experiments.

\subsubsection{Neutrino Masses}
So far, no right-handed neutrinos have been detected. Thus the Standard Model was crafted in a way that neutrinos only occur as left-handed particles.
Recent observations of neutrino oscillations\cite{KamLAND:ReactorAntineutrinoMeasurement,DoubleChooz:Improvedmeasurementsneutrino,IceCube:Determiningneutrinooscillation,DayaBay:NewMeasurementAntineutrino} indicate that neutrinos may be massive. For the theory to remain renormalizable, neutrinos must thus also exist in their right-handed state\cite{Klinkhamer:NeutrinomassStandard}, which demands for an extension or modification of the Standard Model.

\subsubsection{Theoretical Considerations}
From the theoretical point of view, the open questions are mostly due to incomplete theories: 
First, there is no consensus about unification of the gauge interactions. At certain very high energy scales, the gauge interactions are expected to behave similarly. However, the observed Standard Model parameters do not allow for a common point of convergence\cite{Amaldi:Comparisongrandunified}.
Secondly, the framework of quantum field theory does not allow for a non-renormalizable theory such as quantum gravity. Thus, the question about how to combine particle physics and gravity (or rather general relativity) is still open.\footnote{In the context of collider experiments, the effects of gravity are so weak that they can be neglected.}

Another theoretical motivation is the \emph{mass hierarchy problem}: One of the seemingly indisputable energy scales in nature is the Planck scale at $M_\text{Pl} \approx \SI{e18}{\GeV}$. At this scale, gravity becomes as strong as the gauge interactions and nature is expected to behave differently. However, all processes that have been observed so far appear at the electroweak scale $m_\text{EW} \approx \SI{e3}{\GeV}$. This discrepancy between these two scales challenges the generality of the Standard Model.

\section{Extensions of the Standard Model}


\section{Experiments}
Beginning with Rutherford's experiments in the early 20th century, there have been an abundance of particle physics experiments using the approach of particle collisions. Today, most scattering experiments can be classified in two groups: Fixed target experiments and collider experiments. In the former case, accelerated particles are collided with a fixed target, such as Rutherford's gold foils. In the latter case, two beams of particles are made to collide at an interaction point. This allows for a higher center of mass energy and is thus favorable whenever the technical circumstances allow.

In both cases, outgoing scattered particles are registered. 
Because of the statistical nature of quantum mechanics, the Standard Model only describes scattering processes in terms of probabilities. These probabilities depend on particle properties before and after collision. 
Controlling the incoming particles and counting outgoing particles is thus a very efficient way of testing the theory.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The to date largest particle collider experiment is located in a tunnel about \SI{100}{\m} underground just below Geneva in Switzerland. It belongs to the \ac{CERN} and is called \ac{LHC}.

The Large Hadron Collider is a proton-proton collider with a circumference of \SI{26.7}{\km}. It has been built in the early 2000s within the tunnel of the former \ac{LEP}. The tunnel contains the storage ring as well as accelerator structures and experiments. Within two beam pipes, in an ultra-high vacuum (about \SI{e-11}{\milli\bar}), groups of protons circulate in opposite directions. They are accelerated using radio-frequency cavities and kept on track by \num{1232} superconducting dipole and \num{450} quadrupole magnets.

The protons are then brought to collision at one of the four \emph{interaction points} along the ring. The energy of each accelerated proton before collision is \SI{6.5}{\TeV} in the rest system, resulting in a total center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{\TeV}$.

Around each interaction point, a detector has been constructed. The task of two of the experiments is to perform very specialized measurements at lead ions (\acsu{ALICE}) and hadrons made of \Pcharm or \Pbottom quarks (\acsu{LHCb}). 
The other two experiments are aimed at more general measurements. These so called \emph{general purpose} experiments are the \ac{CMS} and the \acsu{ATLAS} experiment\cite{Evans:LHCMachine}.

\end{figure}

This work will focus on the CMS experiment, which will be discussed in the next sections.

\todo{bunches, bunch crossing, pileup?}

\section{The Compact Muon Solenoid}
The \ac{CMS} detector consists of multiple particle detector subsystems surrounding the interaction point.
Its goal is to measure outgoing particles created at proton-proton collisions.
The observed properties include particle type, direction, momentum, energy and charge. Each of the detector subsystems are dedicated to measuring one or more of these characteristics. The subsystems are read out electronically and the data are later analyzed on a computing grid.

An overview of the detector can be seen in \fref{fig:CMS_slice}. The discussion of the detector subsystems in the following sections is based on \cite{Chatrchyan:CMSexperimentCERN} if not explicitly stated otherwise.

The solid lines represent charged particles which are bend due to the magnetic field\cite[modified]{Davis:CMSSlice}.}
    \label{fig:CMS_slice}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Detector Geometry}
In a region starting at \SI{23}{\m} before the detector, both beam pipes are united\cite{Evans:LHCMachine}. The proton groups traveling in opposite directions share the same beam pipe, which defines the $z$-axis of the detector coordinate system. The collisions occur at $z = 0$.
The detector forms a barrel around the beam pipe. The barrel is subdivided into seven slices: five evenly sized \emph{wheels} and one so-called \emph{endcap} on each open side of the barrel. The central wheel is centered at $z = 0$.
Detector layers in the wheels are mostly arranged in a cylindrical manner around the beam pipes, while the layers in the endcaps are mounted orthogonally to the beam pipe.

\subsection{Subsystems}
\subsubsection{Inner Tracking System}
The \emph{inner tracking system} is used for precise measurements of direction and curvature of charged particles. 
It is composed of silicon semiconductor pixel layers surrounded by strip modules.

Each pixel cell is $\SI{100}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{150}{\micro\meter}$ in size. It consists of a silicon semiconductor in reverse bias direction. Charged particles passing through the semiconductor induce ionization and thus allow small currents to flow. These currents are amplified and read out by dedicated electronics. There are about \num{66} million pixel cells, allowing for a very precise measurement of the direction and origin of outgoing particles. High precision is necessary for distinguishing between multiple proton-proton interactions happening within the same bunch crossing (so-called \emph{pile-up} effect), as well as for mechanisms such as \Pbottom-tagging, where an offset of a particle track is used for identifying decays of \PB-mesons (see \fref{sec:b_tagging}).

The strip modules function similarly to the pixel cells. For reduced production costs, typical cell sizes are $\SI{10}{\centi\meter} \times \SI{80}{\micro\meter}$. There are \num{24244} silicon strips in the tracker.

A combination of both tracking subsystems is used during particle reconstruction. 

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
\label{sec:ecal}
The goal of the \ac{ECAL} is to measure the energy of outgoing electrons, positrons and photons. It consists of dense, transparent lead tungstate ($\textup{PbWO}_4$) crystals. Within these crystals, high energetic electrons and photons cause electromagnetic cascades: Electrons emit photons in the process of bremsstrahlung, while photons convert to electron-positron pairs in the process of pair-production.
This leads to large numbers of lower-energy electrons and photons, until the electron energy loss is dominated by ionization losses and the photon energy is below the pair-production threshold of $\si{\electronmass} = \SI{1022}{\keV}$.
Low energetic photons and those emitted by ionization or excitation are eventually registered using photodiodes. The initial particle energy is calculated from the light yield.\cite{ParticleDataGroup:ReviewParticlePhysics}.

As long as the cascade does not leak through the photodetectors, the achieved energy resolution for photons is about \SI{1}{\percent}.\todo{electrons, quelle}

\subsubsection{Hadron Calorimeter}
The \ac{HCAL} measures the energy of hadrons produced during the collision. It is designed as a sampling calorimeter with alternating layers of brass absorbers and plastic scintillator tiles. 

Hadrons passing through the calorimeter interact with the nuclei of the denser brass absorbers. During the collisions, secondary charged (\Pgppm, \Pproton, ...) as well as neutral hadrons (\Pgpz, \Peta, ...) are produced. The charged secondaries cause electromagnetic radiation via ionization while the neutral particles decay into photons, which themselves cause electromagnetic showers (see \ref{sec:ecal}).

The charged particles from electromagnetic showers are detected via scintillation. In the plastic scintillators, passage of charged particles induce emission of optical photons. These are guided to photodiodes using wavelength-shifting fibers. The fiber material suppresses Cherenkov light and do not act as scintillators themselves.\cite{ParticleDataGroup:ReviewParticlePhysics}.

Because of the short radiation lengths in the absorber material, sampling calorimeters are very space efficient as opposed to homogeneous calorimeters.
However, as some of the energy is deposited within the absorber material, the total shower energy is only an estimation from the scintillation light.

Similarly to the electromagnetic calorimeter, a high resolution can be achieved only as long as the showers do not leak through the calorimeter.

\subsubsection{Solenoid Magnet}
The \ac{CMS} solenoid magnet is designed to deliver a magnetic field of \SI{4}{\tesla}. This is achieved by cooling the \SI{220}{\tonne} cold mass to \SI{4.6}{\kelvin}, such that the NbTi wires become superconducting and the current can reach up to \SI{19.5}{\kilo\ampere}.
The magnet surrounds the calorimeters and has a diameter of \SI{6}{\meter}. Within the coil, the magnetic field is approximately homogeneous with the field lines being parallel to the beam pipe. 
Particles passing the field are subject to the Lorentz force which subsequently bends their tracks into circular curvatures.

This effect is essential for identifying particles: Not only allows it to distinguish between charged and neutral particles, but also allows the direct measurement of the particles' momentum

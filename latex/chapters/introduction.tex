\chapter{Introduction}

\section{This Thesis}
This thesis deals with the \acf{MUSiC}, which is a particle physics analysis aiming to find new physics within data observed by the \acs{CMS} experiment.

In the first chapter, we will give a short introduction to the \acl{SM} of particle physics and the \acs{CMS} experiment. 
The second chapter is a description of the \acs{MUSiC} analysis in its current state. It will motivate and explain the different strategies and algorithms employed in the analysis.
Afterwards, we will show the effectiveness of the existing analysis steps using statistical methods as well as simulations of new physics processes.
Finally, we will examine multiple extensions to the search and study their impact on the analysis sensitivity for different new physics models.


\section{Units and Abbreviations}
Throughout this work, we will use the natural unit system. This means that the speed of light and the Planck constant are fixed to $1$:
\begin{equation*}
    \hbar = c = 1
\end{equation*}
It follows that the only unit needed to express most other physical quantities is the unit of energy. Our choice here is electron volts. Too keep numbers in a reasonable range, we mostly use gigaelectronvolts: $\SI{1}{\giga\eV} = \SI{1.60218e-10}{\joule}$.
Two exceptions to this are the cross section and luminosity, which are expressed in femtobarn and inverse femtobarn respectively: $\SI{1}{\femto\barn} = \SI{e-43}{\meter\squared}$.

\section{Particle Physics}
Finding the building blocks of matter has interested mankind for thousands of years. Ancient Greek philosophers already contemplated about the basic building blocks of matter. They coined the term \emph{atom} for what they thought to be indivisible. Since then, our understanding of the smallest parts and what holds them together has vastly improved. This field of science is nowadays called \emph{Elementary Particle Physics}. As of 2017, the state of particle physics research is summed up in the so-called \emph{\acl{SM} of Particle Physics}.

The following sections will be a short introduction to the \acl{SM}, its theoretical foundations and open questions. Motivated by these questions, we will introduce possible extensions to the \acl{SM} in the next chapter.

This chapter is based on \cite{Hebbeker:SkriptzurElementarteilchenphysik} if not explicitly stated otherwise.

\section{The Standard Model}
The \acfi{SM} is a theoretical model describing matter and its interactions through \emph{particles} and \emph{forces}. It was once motivated by classical phenomena such as electromagnetism and particle decays and has since made important predictions about the existence of non-classical forms of matter.

So far, it has not been disproved, although there are some inconsistencies, as we will see later.

\subsection{Particles and Interactions}
Elementary particles are described as point-like indivisible structureless objects, much like the atoms were to the ancient Greeks. These objects are characterized by physical observables such as mass, charge and spin.

\end{figure}

Elementary particles can be subdivided into several groups, as shown in \fref{fig:particle_groups}. 
At the first level, one distinguishes between two groups: \emph{fermions} and \emph{bosons}.

Fermions are elementary particles with a spin of $\nicefrac{1}{2}$. They follow Fermi-Dirac statistics and have to obey Pauli's exclusion principle which states that no more than one particle can occupy a certain state characterized by its quantum numbers.
The group of fermions can be further divided into quarks and leptons.
There are six quarks: up (\Pup), down (\Pdown), charm (\Pcharm), strange (\Pstrange), bottom (\Pbottom) and top (\Ptop). Quarks carry color charge and are the only objects to take part in the strong interaction.
In addition, there are three lepton families: \emph{electron} (\Pe), \emph{muon} (\Pmu) and \emph{tau} (\Ptau). Each charged lepton has a very light, electrically neutral \emph{neutrino} associated with it.

The second group of particles are called bosons. They mediate interactions (also called \emph{forces}) and posses an integer spin. Bosons follow Bose-Einstein statistics and may thus occupy the same quantum state.
Each kind of boson is responsible for one kind of elementary force: the electrodynamic force is mediated by the \emph{photon} (\Pgamma), the strong force by the \emph{gluon} (\Pg) and the weak force by the \emph{\PZ} and \emph{\PW} bosons.
In addition, there is the \emph{Higgs boson} (\PH), which uses the Higgs mechanism to give mass to all mentioned massive elementary particles.\footnote{Note that this does not apply to composite particles (like protons) which gain mask mostly through binding energy.}

In terms of conventional matter, one can conclude that fermions make up matter and bosons hold matter together.

\subsection{Interactions}
\subsubsection{Quantum Electrodynamics}
The theory of electromagnetism at extremely small or extremely high energetic scales is called \acfi{QED}. It is a field theory that unifies classical quantum mechanics, special relativity and gauge invariance.

Because the probability amplitude of a quantum mechanical wave function is independent of the wave's phase, two wave functions that only differ in phase are equivalent. Thus, physics processes should behave exactly the same, regardless of the phase term. This concept is called \emph{invariance under phase transformations} and is a necessary property for quantum field theories.

In 1928, the British physicist Paul Dirac derived an relativistic extension of the classical SchrÃ¶dinger equation by substituting observables with corresponding operators in the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = p^2 + m^2$. The resulting so-called \emph{Dirac equation} describes the behavior of free spin-\nicefrac{1}{2} particles and even predicts the existence of antiparticles.
However, the Dirac equation is not invariant under phase transformations and thus Richard Feynman et al. developed a gauge invariant extension of Dirac's theory. This extension, quantum electrodynamics, was awarded the Nobel prize in 1965\cite{NobelMedia:NobelPrize1965}.

In \ac{QED} interactions happen between exactly two charged particles and one photon, as show in \fref{fig:qed_vertices}: Two particles may annihilate into one photon, a photon may be emitted or absorbed, or a particle-antiparticle pair may be created from the photon energy. In each case, the electrical charge is conserved.

\subsubsection{Weak Interaction}
Theoretical research on the \emph{weak interaction} started in 1933 when Enrico Fermi proposed a contact interaction theory explaining the $\upbeta$-decay. 
In 1968, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg revised this theory by predicting a resolved, finite range force within the framework of \acfi{QFD}. This force is propagated by  massive vector bosons, the charged \PWpm and the neutral \PZ. It was only in 1983 that these particles were experimentally confirmed by Carlo Rubia's group at \ac{CERN}\cite[p. 48]{Griffiths:IntroductionElementaryParticles}.

The weak interaction via the \PW boson allows changing particles' types (also called \emph{flavor}). For leptons, the basic interaction vertex always consists of one neutrino, one heavy fermion and a \PW boson. In the case of quarks, the \PW boson couples to a quark pair. Each quark pair has a predetermined probability to couple to the \PW boson, as expressed by the \acsu{CKM} matrix.

The flavor changing interaction allows heavy fermions to decay into lighter decay products. As long as there is a lighter particle to decay into, the probability of this decay does not vanish.
Consequently, only the lightest fermions are stable: the electron, the \Pqu- and \Pqd-quarks and the neutrinos.

\subsubsection{Quantum Chromodynamics}
The theory of \acfi{QCD} began in the 1950s, when bubble chamber experiments unexpectedly discovered large numbers of hadrons with different masses and physical properties. 
Instead of assuming that these particles were fundamental, theorist Murray Gell-Mann et al. proposed a theory where they were made up of constituents, so-called \emph{quarks}. 
The theory of bound states of the three known quarks (\Pqu, \Pqd, \Pqs) and their excitations was able to reproduce many of the observations.
However, the observed $\Updelta^\text{++}$ baryon seemed to violate Pauli's exclusion principle: It consists of three \Pqu quarks with parallel spins. This dilemma was resolved in 1964, when Oscar W. Greenberg proposed a new quantum number, called \emph{color charge}.
Alongside this quantum number, the existence of a gauge boson was predicted, the gluon, which was discovered around 1980 in three-jet events.

The basic interaction vertices of \ac{QCD} are shown in \fref{fig:qcd_vertices}. The charge of the strong interaction is called color-charge, its possible values are usually called \emph{red}, \emph{green}, \emph{blue}, antired, antigreen and antiblue\footnote{Note that this concept is completely unrelated to visual perception of color.}.
Quarks carry one unit of color charge, while gluons carry two units. Color charge is conserved within each interaction vertex. 
An important principle of \ac{QCD} is that all naturally occurring particles are colorless: A composite particle carries either all colors (red + green + blue) or a color and its anti-color (e.g. red + antired). The former is found in baryons and the latter in mesons.

Another important phenomenon in connection with \ac{QCD} is \emph{quark confinement}: As two quarks are separated from each other, new quark-antiquark pairs are created from the expended energy. Each created quark binds with one of the separated quarks such that all quarks again end up in a bound state.
This effect has important consequences in the experimental context: Quarks and gluons in the final state of a collision often posses excess kinetic energy and thus move away from each other. Because of the confinement effect, new hadrons form. This effect is called \emph{hadronization}. Repeated hadronization leads to the formation of so-called \emph{jets}.

\subsection{The Higgs Mechanism}

\subsection{Open Questions}
Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, all particles predicted by the Standard Model have been experimentally observed. The Standard Model has not been disproved and multiple Nobel prices have been awarded.
One could assume that our understanding of nature is now complete, but this is not the case:
In the recent decades, several observations have been made that demand  theories beyond the Standard Model. In the following sections, we want to discuss a few of them.

%Observations: gravitational waves (2016), neutrino masses

\subsubsection{Astrophysical Observations}
One astrophysical research method is to probe whether observed gravitational effects can be completely accounted for by visible matter distributions. For this purpose, the rotation curves of galaxies have been measured and shown to be incompatible with simulations of visible matter only. Also, fluctuations in gravitational lensing without a visible origin has been observed.\cite{Bertone:Particledarkmatter,Peebles:Cosmologicalconstantdark}
Furthermore, several experiments have probed the cosmic microwave background for anisotropies. These data have subsequently been compared to the matter distributions obtained by simulations of the early universe according to the $\Uplambda$CDM model. The results indicated that only about \SI{5}{\percent} of the universe is made up of conventional (baryonic) matter.\cite{Planck:Planck2015results}
% https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.0939v2.pdf

All of these findings suggest that there must be a large amount of matter in the universe that only interacts gravitationally. Because of its electromagnetic invisibility, it is called \emph{Dark Matter}.
Since the Standard Model does not provide a fitting Dark Matter candidate, this is an active field of research also at particle collider experiments.

\subsubsection{Neutrino Masses}
So far, no right-handed neutrinos have been detected. Thus the Standard Model was crafted in a way that neutrinos only occur as left-handed particles.
Recent observations of neutrino oscillations\cite{KamLAND:ReactorAntineutrinoMeasurement,DoubleChooz:Improvedmeasurementsneutrino,IceCube:Determiningneutrinooscillation,DayaBay:NewMeasurementAntineutrino} indicate that neutrinos may be massive. For the theory to remain renormalizable, neutrinos must thus also exist in their right-handed state\cite{Klinkhamer:NeutrinomassStandard}, which demands for an extension or modification of the Standard Model.

\subsubsection{Theoretical Considerations}
From the theoretical point of view, the open questions are mostly due to incomplete theories: 
First, there is no consensus about unification of the gauge interactions. At certain very high energy scales, the gauge interactions are expected to behave similarly. However, the observed Standard Model parameters do not allow for a common point of convergence\cite{Amaldi:Comparisongrandunified}.
Secondly, the framework of quantum field theory does not allow for a non-renormalizable theory such as quantum gravity. Thus, the question about how to combine particle physics and gravity (or rather general relativity) is still open.\footnote{In the context of collider experiments, the effects of gravity are so weak that they can be neglected.}

Another theoretical motivation is the \emph{mass hierarchy problem}: One of the seemingly indisputable energy scales in nature is the Planck scale at $M_\text{Pl} \approx \SI{e18}{\GeV}$. At this scale, gravity becomes as strong as the gauge interactions and nature is expected to behave differently. However, all processes that have been observed so far appear at the electroweak scale $m_\text{EW} \approx \SI{e3}{\GeV}$. The discrepancy between these two scales challenges the generality of the Standard Model.

\section{Extensions of the Standard Model}
Some solutions have been proposed to these problems. In this work, four extension beyond the \acl{SM} will be relevant and thus introduced in the following sections.
%
%\subsubsection{$R$-Parity Violating Supersymmetry}
%There are several extensions falling under the name \acfi{SUSY}, but they all share a common feature: The pairing of each \acl{SM} particle with a much heavier so-called \emph{superpartner} (sometimes also called \emph{sparticle}). Superpartners of \ac{SM} fermions are \acs{SUSY} bosons, \ac{SM} bosons are complemented with \acs{SUSY} fermions. Their high mass makes them more difficult to detect, as only now science is peaking into the \si{\TeV} range.
%
%An implication of this is the violation of lepton and baryon number. The latter effect would also enable decay of free protons, which to date has not been observed. 
%One way to solve this problem is the introduction of an additional quantum number $R$: \ac{SM} particles are assigned $R = +1$, while \ac{SUSY} particles have $R = -1$. $R$ must then be conserved at each interaction, allowing \ac{SUSY} particles to be created only in pairs, and preventing proton decay.
%
%So far, \ac{SUSY} models containing the notion of $R$-parity have been tightly constrained. Thus, some analyses focus on theories where $R$-parity conservation is violated and stabilize the proton in other ways.
%
%The \ac{RPV-SUSY} model under investigation falls into this category. It stabilizes the proton by introducing a symmetry that cancels out the baryon number violating terms. 
%Among its signatures is the resonant production of \ac{SUSY} particles from quark-quark annihilation, which decays into a \Pe \Pmu pair, violating the lepton number (see \fref{fig:rpv_signature}).\cite{CMS:CMS-PAS-EXO-16-001}

%\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Extra Dimensions and Black Holes}
One class of approaches addressing the mass hierarchy problem is the introduction of additional spatial dimensions. Within the \acf{ADD} model\cite{Arkani-Hamed:Hierarchyproblemnew}, in addition to our four known dimensions, $n$ extra dimensions are assumed to exist. These dimensions are compactified on a length scale of $R$. On this scale and below, gravity is able to penetrate multiple dimensions, making it stronger than it appears in the classical four dimensions. Thus, the true Planck scale for $n$ extra dimensions is much lower than the apparent Planck scale:
\begin{equation}
    M_\text{Pl}^2 \sim M_{\text{Pl}(4+n)}^{2+n} R^n
\end{equation}
%By setting the desired Planck scale to $M_{\text{Pl}(4+n)}^{2+n} \approx m_\text{EW}$, we find that the compactification scale for $n = $ \numrange{2}{4} extra dimensions is between \SI{1}{\milli\meter} and \SI{1}{\pico\meter}.

An interesting consequence of these assumptions is the possibility to produce black holes within collider experiments\cite{Dimopoulos:BlackHolesLHCa}: As derived from a semiclassical perspective, the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with $M_\text{BH} \sim \si{\TeV}$ is larger than the minimum separation distance of two partons at the collision. Thus, a microscopic black hole can form.

In this thesis, we will look at two different models of black holes within the \acs{LHC}: semiclassical black holes and quantum black holes.
\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{semiclassical black hole} is presumed to behave similarly to a classical astronomical black hole, except for the fact that it can only exist through additional extra dimensions: After formation, it reaches thermal equilibrium (\emph{thermalizes}) and subsequently evaporates via Hawking radiation. During this phase, a large number of \ac{SM} particles is produced. The relative abundance of these particles is expected to follow the number of degrees of freedom per \ac{SM} particle. Among the possible final states are many that violate the lepton number conservation and thus make excellent experimental signatures with low expected \ac{SM} contribution.\cite{CMS:CMS-PAS-EXO-15-007}
\item A \emph{quantum black hole} is too short-lived to thermalize. Instead, it behaves like a quantum object and decays into few particles. As with the semiclassical case, lepton flavor violating final states are accessible within this model. For this thesis, a benchmark model has been chosen that decays solely into a \Pe + \Pmu pair. As this final state violates conservation of lepton number, there is no real \ac{SM} background contribution. However, through experimental practice, particles from an \ac{SM} process can be misclassified and contribute to the background yield.\cite{CMS:CMS-PAS-EXO-16-001}

\subsubsection{Seesaw Type III Model}
The so-called Seesaw model aims to explain the low neutrino masses. In this model, the neutrino masses are considered to arise via the mediation of massive fermion partners. Two additional charged partners $\PSigmapm$ are predicted alongside a neutral Majorana particle $\PSigmazero$.
Within the \ac{LHC}, the particles are produced in pairs as electroweak decay products as shown in \fref{fig:seesaw_production}.

    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
Subsequent decays of the gauge bosons as well as the \Ptau lepton allow for a plethora of accessible final states.

\subsubsection{Sequential Standard Model and \PWprime}
Another common extension of the \ac{SM} is the \acfi{SSM}. In the \acl{SSM}, heavier copies of the \ac{SM} gauge bosons are introduced. They behave exactly like the \PW and \PZ bosons and are consequently called \PWprime and \PZprime. 
The masses are assumed to lay within the \si{\TeV} range and the expected experimental signatures are similar to those of the \ac{SM} gauge bosons.

In this thesis, a model has been chosen where only the \PWprime boson exists and it may only decay into a \Pqt + \Pqb pair. This corresponds to the scenario used in dedicated analyses performed by the \ac{CMS} and \ac{ATLAS} collaborations\cite{ATLASCollaboration:SearchWtb,CMSCollaboration:SearchesWbosons,CMS:CMS-PAS-B2G-17-010}.


\section{Experiments}
Beginning with Rutherford's experiments in the early 20th century, there have been an abundance of particle physics experiments using the approach of particle collisions. Today, most scattering experiments can be classified in two groups: Fixed target experiments and collider experiments. In the former case, accelerated particles are collided with a fixed target, such as Rutherford's gold foils. In the latter case, two beams of particles are made to collide at an interaction point. This allows for a higher center of mass energy and is thus favorable whenever the technical circumstances allow.

In both cases, outgoing scattered particles are registered. 
Because of the statistical nature of quantum mechanics, the Standard Model only describes scattering processes in terms of probabilities. These probabilities depend on particle properties before and after collision. 
Controlling the incoming particles and counting outgoing particles is thus a very efficient way of testing the theory.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The to date largest particle collider experiment is located in a tunnel about \SI{100}{\m} underground just below Geneva in Switzerland. It belongs to the \acfi{CERN} and is called \acfi{LHC}.

The Large Hadron Collider is a proton-proton collider with a circumference of \SI{26.7}{\km}. It has been built in the early 2000s within the tunnel of the former \acfi{LEP}. The tunnel contains the storage ring as well as accelerator structures and experiments. Within two beam pipes, in an ultra-high vacuum (about \SI{e-11}{\milli\bar}), groups of protons circulate in opposite directions. They are accelerated using radio-frequency cavities and kept on track by \num{1232} superconducting dipole and \num{450} quadrupole magnets.

The protons are then brought to collision at one of the four \emph{interaction points} along the ring. The energy of each accelerated proton before collision is \SI{6.5}{\TeV} in the rest system, resulting in a total center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{\TeV}$.

Around each interaction point, a detector has been constructed. The task of two of the experiments is to perform very specialized measurements at lead ions (\acsu{ALICE}) and hadrons made of \Pcharm or \Pbottom quarks (\acsu{LHCb}). 
The other two experiments are aimed at more general measurements. These so-called \emph{general purpose} experiments are the \acfi{CMS} and the \acsu{ATLAS} experiment\cite{Evans:LHCMachine}.

Protons first pass through several stages of preacceleration within the \ac{LINAC} 2, \ac{PS}, the \ac{PSB} and the \ac{SPS}. Eventually, they are injected into the \ac{LHC} where they circulate in opposite directions. The two beams are further accelerated in radio-frequency cavities and their shape is restored within the cleaning sections of the ring. At each revolution, some of the protons are made to collide within one of the four experiments \acs{CMS}, \acs{ATLAS}, \acs{LHCb} and \acs{ALICE}. Once they are not needed anymore, the remaining protons can be dumped into massive metal blocks at the dump site.

This work will focus on the \ac{CMS} experiment, which will be discussed in the next sections.

\section{The Compact Muon Solenoid}
The \ac{CMS} detector consists of multiple particle detector subsystems surrounding the interaction point.
Its goal is to measure outgoing particles created at proton-proton collisions.
The observed properties include particle type, direction, momentum, energy and charge. Each of the detector subsystems are dedicated to measuring one or more of these characteristics. The subsystems are read out electronically and the data are later analyzed on a computing grid.

An overview of the detector can be seen in \fref{fig:CMS_slice}. The discussion of the detector subsystems in the following sections is based on \cite{Chatrchyan:CMSexperimentCERN} if not explicitly stated otherwise.

\subsection{Detector Geometry and Coordinates}
In a region starting at \SI{23}{\m} before the detector, both beam pipes are united\cite{Evans:LHCMachine}. The proton groups traveling in opposite directions share the same beam pipe, which defines the $z$-axis of the detector coordinate system. The collisions occur approximately at the interaction point at $z = 0$.
The detector forms a barrel around the beam pipe. The barrel is subdivided into seven slices: five evenly sized \emph{wheels} and one so-called \emph{endcap} on each open side of the barrel. The central wheel is centered at $z = 0$.
Detector layers in the wheels are mostly arranged in a cylindrical manner around the beam pipes, while the layers in the endcaps are mounted orthogonally to the beam pipe.

The direction of an outgoing particle originating in the interaction point can be characterized using a spherical coordinate system $(\phi, \theta)$. The azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured with reference to an imaginary line connecting the interaction point to the center of the \ac{LHC} ring. $\theta$ indicates the polar angle between the $z$-axis and the direction of interest.
However, $\theta$ is rarely used because it is not invariant towards Lorentz-boosts in the $z$ direction. Instead, the Lorentz-invariant pseudo-rapidity $\eta \defeq -\ln\left[\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right]$ is used to describe the angular separation between a particle and the beam pipe. The detector components in context of $\eta$ ranges can be found in \fref{fig:cms_quadrant}.

To indicate angular separation between particles, the quantity $R = \sqrt{\Delta \eta^2 + \Delta \phi^2}$, which is Lorentz-invariant, can be defined. $\eta$ and $R$ will be relevant in context of particle reconstruction.

\subsection{Bunch Crossings and Pile-Up}
\label{sec:pileup}

For acceleration reasons, protons in the \ac{LHC} are grouped into packets called \emph{bunches}. At the interaction point, proton bunches from both directions collide every \SI{25}{\nano\second}, defining the so-called \emph{bunch crossing}. During each bunch crossing, multiple proton pairs may interact with each other. This multitude of collisions is called \emph{pile-up effect}.

Similarly, the collision of a single proton pair may result in multiple partons interacting with each other. This ambiguity is resolved by only analyzing the interaction with the highest momentum transfer, called \emph{hard interaction}. Other interactions contribute to the so-called \emph{underlying event}.

\subsection{Subsystems}
\subsubsection{Inner Tracking System}
The \emph{inner tracking system} is used for precise measurements of direction and curvature of charged particles. 
It is composed of silicon semiconductor pixel layers surrounded by strip modules.

Each pixel cell consists of a silicon semiconductor in reverse bias direction. Charged particles passing through the semiconductor induce ionization and thus allow small currents to flow. These currents are amplified and read out by dedicated electronics. There are about \num{66} million pixel cells, each with a size of $\SI{100}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{150}{\micro\meter}$, allowing for a high spacial resolution.

The strip modules function similarly to the pixel cells. For reduced production costs, typical cell sizes are $\SI{10}{\centi\meter} \times \SI{80}{\micro\meter}$. There are \num{24244} silicon strips in the tracker.

A very high spacial resolution around the interaction point is necessary for finding the origin of decay products. This is achieved by tracing the particle tracks back to the location of their parent particles. The information is later used to discard particle tracks originating in pile-up  events or the underlying event (see \fref{sec:pileup}), as well as for identifying decays of \PB-mesons (see \fref{sec:b_tagging}).

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
\label{sec:ecal}
The goal of the \acfi{ECAL} is to measure the energy of outgoing electrons, positrons and photons. 

It consists of dense, transparent lead tungstate ($\textup{PbWO}_4$) crystals. Within these crystals, high energetic electrons and photons cause electromagnetic cascades: Electrons emit photons in the process of bremsstrahlung, while photons convert to electron-positron pairs in the process of pair-production.
This leads to large numbers of lower-energy electrons and photons, until the electron energy loss is dominated by ionization losses and the photon energy is below the pair-production threshold of $2 \si{\electronmass} = \SI{1022}{\keV}$.
Low energetic photons and those emitted by ionization or excitation are eventually registered using photodiodes. The initial particle energy is calculated from the light yield.\cite{ParticleDataGroup:ReviewParticlePhysics}.

As long as the cascade does not leak through the photodetectors, the achieved energy resolution for photons is about \SI{1}{\percent}.\todo{electrons, quelle}

\subsubsection{Hadron Calorimeter}
The \acfi{HCAL} measures the energy of hadrons produced during the collision. 

It is designed as a sampling calorimeter with alternating layers of brass absorbers and plastic scintillator tiles. Hadrons passing through the calorimeter interact with nuclei of the denser brass absorbers. During collisions, secondary charged (\Pgppm, \Pproton, ...) as well as neutral hadrons (\Pgpz, \Peta, ...) are produced. The charged secondaries cause electromagnetic radiation via ionization while the neutral particles decay into photons, which themselves cause electromagnetic showers (see \fref{sec:ecal}).

The charged particles from electromagnetic showers are detected via scintillation. In the plastic scintillators, passage of charged particles induce emission of optical photons. These are guided to photodiodes using wavelength-shifting fibers. The fiber material suppresses Cherenkov light and do not act as scintillators themselves.\cite{ParticleDataGroup:ReviewParticlePhysics}.

Because of the short radiation lengths in the absorber material, sampling calorimeters are more space efficient than homogeneous calorimeters.
However, as some of the energy is deposited within the absorber material, the total shower energy can only be estimated from the scintillation light.

Similarly to the electromagnetic calorimeter, a high resolution can be achieved only as long as the showers do not leak through the calorimeter.

\subsubsection{Solenoid Magnet}
The \ac{CMS} solenoid magnet is designed to deliver a magnetic field strength of \SI{4}{\tesla}. This is achieved by cooling the \SI{220}{\tonne} cold mass to \SI{4.6}{\kelvin}, such that the NbTi wires become superconducting and the current can reach up to \SI{19.5}{\kilo\ampere}.
The magnet surrounds the calorimeters and has a diameter of \SI{6}{\meter}. Within the coil, the magnetic field is approximately uniform with the field lines being parallel to the beam pipe. Outside, the magnetic field lines are closed by an iron yoke, which is interspersed with the muon system.

Particles passing the field are subject to the Lorentz force which subsequently bends their tracks into circular curvatures. This effect allows to distinguish between charged and neutral particles and enables measurement of particle momenta independently of their energy.

\subsubsection{Muon System}
The goal of the muon system is to detect muons and measure their tracks, from which the muon momenta are calculated.

Because of their high mass compared to electrons, muons are less affected by the electromagnetic fields within matter, reducing their radiative losses. This makes them the only detectable particles to pass through all inner detector subsystems as well as the solenoid coil.
For this reason, the muon system is the outermost part of the detector. It surrounds the solenoid coil and consists of \emph{drift tubes} (\acsu{DT}s) in the barrel section and \emph{cathode strip chambers} (\acsu{CSC}s) in the endcaps. The muon barrel section extends in $\abs{\eta}$ up to \num{0.9}, the endcap region lies between $\abs{\eta}$ of \num{1.2} and \num{2.4}. In the range between \num{0.9} and \num{1.2}, the muon systems overlap.

Drift tubes have a length of about \SI{2}{\meter} and a cross section of $\SI{13}{\milli\meter} \times \SI{42}{\milli\meter}$. In the center of each tube, there is an anode wire. Between the wire and the tube walls exists a high electric potential. Additionally, the tubes are filled with a gas mixture. 
As the charged muons pass through the gas, they ionize a few of the gas atoms. The released electrons accelerate along the electric field lines and induce an avalanche of secondary ionizations. Eventually, the accumulated charges are deposited in the anode wires and are measurable as current spike\cite{ParticleDataGroup:ReviewParticlePhysics}.

From the amount of deposited charge and timing measurements, a spacial resolution of less than \SI{250}{\micro\meter} can be achieved across each chamber. However, determining the location in the wire direction is not possible with this arrangement.

In the endcap region, the muon system consists of cathode strip chambers instead of drift tubes. \acp{CSC} work similarly to drift tubes, but instead of having a single cathode at the chamber walls, they contain multiple cathode strips, which are aligned orthogonally to the wires and read out separately.
The advantage of measuring all three dimensions makes them suited for use in the endcap regions where the magnetic field is not uniform.

\subsection{Triggering}
\label{sec:triggering}
As mentioned in \fref{sec:pileup}, the \ac{LHC} delivers collisions about every \SI{25}{\nano\second}, resulting in around \num{40} million events per second. Even with a raw event size of about \SI{1}{\mega\byte}, storing all events would require a bandwidth of \SI{40}{\tera\byte\per\second}. Currently, there is no technology capable of this task, especially considering the outer circumstances such as irradiation and the strong magnetic field.

Thus, the rate of events accepted for storage and analysis has to be drastically reduced. This is the task of the \emph{triggering system}. Based on the physics content, statistics and bandwidth restrictions, triggers decide whether or not to store an event to disk.

Triggering is implemented in a two step process: First, the \acfi{L1} trigger is consulted. It is implemented in dedicated hardware and uses information from the calorimeters and the muon system to reject low-energetic events. Events passing \ac{L1} will be read out, temporarily stored and further evaluated by the \acfi{HLT}. The \ac{HLT} is implemented in software and running on computers next to the detector cavern. It has access to the full detector information to decide whether an event is eventually stored or rejected.

\subsection{The Computing Grid}
Reconstruction and analyses are ran on the stored events. For this purpose, \ac{CERN} maintains several server farms, organized within the \acfi{WLCG} project.

The facilities are organized in layers called \emph{tiers}. Tier 0 is the \ac{CERN} data center in Geneva. It store raw data and performs initial reconstruction. The data are then distributed to tier 1 computing centers. There are currently 13 tier 1 centers worldwide. They perform further processing on the data and distribute it to tier 3 facilities.

Most of the around 155 tier 3 computing centers belong to universities and other scientific institutes\cite{CERN:Gridsystemtiers}. They produce \ac{MC} simulations and perform scientific analyses. One of these tier 3 centers is operated at the physics department of the RWTH Aachen University, currently providing around \num{5200} processing cores and \SI{3}{\peta\byte} of storage\cite{UniRWTHAachenIII.PhysikalischesInstitut:GridComputing}.
